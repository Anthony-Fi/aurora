🚀 Project Goal
Create a self-hosted, real-time space weather dashboard focused on Finland, using Docker. The site will:

Pull raw data from NOAA, SWPC, FMI,
Process and visualize metrics like Bz, Bt, solar wind speed/density, Boyle Index, VxBz

Display Kp index, magnetometer readings, solar imagery, and RX aurora forecast

Run on your own backend, with full control over layout and logic

🧱 Architecture Overview
Layer	Tech Stack	Purpose
Frontend	HTML, CSS, JS, Chart.js	Display graphs, metrics, and forecasts
Backend	Node.js + Express (or Python)	Fetch, process, and serve data
Container	Docker	Portability and deployment
Scheduler	Cron or Node scheduler	Periodic data updates
🔌 Data Sources & What to Pull
Source	Data to Fetch	Notes
NOAA SWPC	Bz, Bt, Speed, Density, Kp Index	JSON feeds available
RWC Finland	RX forecast, Kevo magnetometer	Scrape or request API access
Jemma.mobi	Boyle Index, VxBz, RX, solar wind	Scrape dashboard or parse embedded data
NASA/NOAA	Solar imagery (visible light, X-ray)	Use latest image URLs or FTP feeds
🧠 Backend Logic
Fetch & Cache: Pull data every 5–10 minutes, store in memory or lightweight DB

Process Metrics:

Boyle Index = speed * |bz| / 1000

VxBz = speed * bz

Serve API: Create endpoints like /api/solarwind, /api/kp, /api/rx

Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) index is a powerful tool for tracking geomagnetic storms—perfect for a space weather website. Let’s break it down and then explore how you can integrate it.

What Is the Dst Index?
The Dst index measures the strength of the Earth's ring current, which intensifies during geomagnetic storms. This current flows westward around Earth’s equator and weakens the planet’s magnetic field.

Units: Measured in nanoTeslas (nT)

Source: Derived from magnetometers at four low-latitude observatories

Purpose: Quantifies the depression in Earth’s magnetic field during storms

A negative Dst value means the magnetic field is weakened—typically due to solar wind or coronal mass ejections (CMEs)2.

📊 Dst Index Value Interpretation
Dst Value (nT)	Storm Classification	Impact
0 to -30	Quiet to weak disturbance	Minimal geomagnetic activity
-30 to -50	Minor storm	Slight auroral activity
-50 to -100	Moderate storm	Visible auroras at higher latitudes
-100 to -250	Intense storm	Possible satellite, GPS, and power grid issues
Below -250	Severe storm	High risk to infrastructure and navigation
Example: The March 1989 storm hit -589 nT, causing a major blackout in Quebec.

The average depression is calculated hourly and reported as the Dst index.
